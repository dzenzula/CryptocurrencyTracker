# CryptocurrencyTracker

Appliction tracks cryptocurrency and information about them.

# Used Libraries
- LiveChart
- Newtosoft.JSON
- Unity for container

# Known issues
- Very slow charts (maybe need another library or change how the graph is drawn)
- Radio buttons doesn't reset after selecting another crypto (don't know how to fix this yet)
- Some repetitive code (need refactoring)
- Window with information about crypto not MVVM (need more knowledge or do it differently)
